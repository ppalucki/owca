MeasurementRunner
=================


MeasurementRunner run iterations to collect platform, resource, task measurements
and store them in metrics_storage component.

- `node`: **type**:

    Component used for tasks discovery.

- ``metrics_storage``: **type** = `DEFAULT_STORAGE`

    Storage to store platform, internal, resource and task metrics.
    (defaults to DEFAULT_STORAGE/LogStorage to output for standard error)

- ``interval``: **Numeric(0,60)** = *1.*

    Iteration duration in seconds (None disables wait and iterations).
    (defaults to 1 second)

- ``rdt_enabled``: **Optional[bool]** = *None*

    Enables or disabled support for RDT monitoring.
    (defaults to None(auto) based on platform capabilities)

- ``gather_hw_mm_topology``: **Optional[bool]** = *None*

    Gather hardware/memory topology based on dmidecode and ipmctl.
    (defaults to None(auto) based on dmidecode and ipmctl binaries availability)

- ``extra_labels``: **Optional[Dict[Str, Str]]** = *None*

    Additional labels attached to every metrics.
    (defaults to empty dict)

- ``event_names``: **List[str]** = `[]`

    Perf counters to monitor.
    (defaults to not collect perf counters - empty list of events)

- ``perf_aggregate_cpus``: **bool** = `True`

    Should perf events collected for cgroups be aggregated (sum) by CPUs.
    (defaults to true, to limit number of exposed metrics)

- ``enable_derived_metrics``: **bool** = *False*

    Enable derived metrics ips, ipc and cache_hit_ratio.
    (based on enabled_event names, default to False)

- ``uncore_event_names``: **List[str]** = `[]`

    Enable perf event uncore metrics.
    (defaults to None - automatic, if available enable)

- ``task_label_generators``: **Optional[Dict[str, TaskLabelGenerator]]** = *None*

    Component to generate additional labels for tasks.
    (optional)

- ``allocation_configuration``: **Optional[AllocationConfiguration]** = *None*

    Allows fine grained control over allocations.
    (defaults to AllocationConfiguration() instance)

- ``wss_reset_cycles``: **Optional[int]** = *None*

    Interval of resetting WSS (WorkingSetSize).
    (defaults to None, which means that metric is not collected at all, e.g. when set to 1
    ``clear_refs`` will be reset every measurement iteration defined by global ``interval``
    option.)
    If set to 0, referenced bytes will be collected but will not be reset in cycling manner.

- ``wss_stable_cycles``: **int** = *0*

    Number of stable cycles after which "referenced bytes rate" is considered stable.
    Optionaly if postive and wss_reset_cycles is 0, then after stabilization period
    will reset "referenced bytes".

    It's behavior depends on wss_reset_cycles:
    - completly ignored if wss_reset_cycles is None (referenced bytes and WSS is disabled).
    - if "wss_reset_cycles" is set to special value "0" and "wss_stable_cycles" is positive then
      after achieving stability "referenced bytes" will be reset (to restart cycle).

    Can be specified as neagtive number which means that stabililty check is enabled
    but after stabilization the "referenced bytes" will not bet reset
    (relay on wss_reset_cycles to be positive and reset).

    Expressed in number of WCA measurements intervals (cycles).
    E.g. if global interval is set to 15s and wss_stable_cycles is set to 40 cycles,
    the "stability condition" is met in consecutive 40 cycles (about 600s = 10 minutes).


- ``wss_membw_threshold``: **Optional[float]** = *None*

    Value used to calculate threshold based on fraction of memory bandwidth (transferred bytes)
    to treat referenced value as stable and return WSS.
    Memory bandwidth multiplied by this value.  None means condition is ignored and
    task_working_set_size_bytes metric will not be collected.

    E.g. 0.1 means membw * 0.1 = which equals to 10% of memory bandwidth.

- ``include_optional_labels``: **bool** = *False*

    Attach following labels to all metrics:
    `sockets`, `cores`, `cpus`, `cpu_model`, `cpu_model_number` and `wca_version`

- ``zoneinfo``: **Union[Str, bool]** = *True*

    By default when zoneinfo is enabled, all the metrics matching to '{name} {value}'
    will be collected.  False means disable the collection.

    If string is provided it will be used as regexp to extract information from /proc/zoneinfo
    (only matching regexp will be collected). Regexp should contains two groups. When zoneinfo
    is True default value for this regexp can parse values like "nr_pages 1234".

- ``vmstat``: **Union[Str, bool]** = *True*

    By default when vmstat is enabled, all the metrics matching to '{name} {value}'
    will be collected.  False means disable the collection.

    If string is provided it will be used as regexp to match key.

- ``sched``: **Union[Str, bool]** = *False*

    Responsible for collecting data from /proc/PID/sched metric:
    - task_sched_stat (lines with ':'),
    - task_sched_stat_numa_faults (numa_faults field).
    By default sched is enabled and all metrics (lines from /proc/PID/sched containg ':')
    will be collected.  False means disable the collection.

    If string is provided it will be used as regexp to match key (string before ':')

StaticNode
==========

Simple implementation of Node that returns tasks based on
provided list on tasks names.

Tasks are returned only if corresponding cgroups exists:

- ``/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/(task_name)``
- ``/sys/fs/cgroup/cpuacct/(task_name)``
- ``/sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event/(task_name)``

Otherwise, the item is ignored.

Arguments:

NUMAAllocator
=============


For fuller documentation please refer to `NUMAAllocator documentation <numa_allocator.rst>`_.

Allocator aims to minimize remote NUMA memory accesses for processes.

- ``algorithm``: **NUMAAlgorithm** = *'fill_biggest_first'*:
    - *'fill_biggest_first'*

        Algorithm only cares about sum of already pinned task's memory to each numa node.
        In each step tries to pin the biggest possible task to numa node, where sum of
        pinned task is the lowest.

    - *'minimize_migrations'*

        Algorithm tries to minimize amount of memory which needs to be remigrated
        between numa nodes.  Into consideration takes information: where a task
        memory is allocated (on which NUMA nodes), which are nodes where the sum
        of pinned memory is the lowest and which are nodes where most
        free memory is available.

- ``loop_min_task_balance``: **float** = *0.0*:

    Useful when autoNUMA used on system.
    Minimal value of task_balance so the task is not skipped during rebalancing analysis
    by default turn off, none of tasks are skipped due to this reason.

- ``free_space_check``: **bool** = *False*:

    If True, then do not pin task to node where there is not enough free memory.


- ``migrate_pages``: **bool** = *True*:

    If use syscall "migrate pages" (forced, synchronous migrate pages of a task)


- ``migrate_pages_min_task_balance``: **Optional[float]** = *0.95*:

    Works if migrate_pages == True. Then if set tells,
    when remigrate pages of already pinned task.
    If not at least ``migrate_pages_min_task_balance * TASK_TOTAL_SIZE``
    bytes of memory resides on pinned node, then
    tries to remigrate all pages allocated on other nodes to target node.


- ``cgroups_memory_binding``: **bool** = *False*:

    cgroups based memory binding


- ``cgroups_memory_migrate``: **bool** = *False*:

    cgroups based memory migrating; can be used only when
    cgroups_memory_binding is set to True


- ``dryrun``: **bool** = *False*:

    If set to True, do not make any allocations - can be used for debugging.




StaticAllocator
===============

Simple allocator based on rules defining relation between task labels
and allocation definition (set of concrete values).

The allocator reads allocation rules from a yaml file and directly
from constructor argument (passed as python dictionary).
Refer to configs/extra/static_allocator_config.yaml to see sample
input file for StaticAllocator.

A rule is an object with three fields:

- ``name``,
- ``labels (optional)``,
- ``allocations`` `<allocation.rst>`_

First field is just a helper to name a rule.
Second field contains a dictionary, where each key is a task's label name and
the value is a regex defining the matching set of label values. If the field
is not included then all tasks match the rule.
The third field is a dictionary of allocations which should be applied to
matching tasks.

If there are multiple matching rules then the rules' allocations are merged and applied.

Arguments:

- ``rules``: **List[dict]** = *None*

    Direct way to pass rules.


- ``config``: **Path** = *None*

    Filepath of yaml config file with rules.



SSL
===


Common configuration for SSL communication.

- ``server_verify``: **Union[bool, Path(absolute=True, mode=os.R_OK)]** = *True*
- ``client_cert_path``: **Optional[Path(absolute=True, mode=os.R_OK)]** = *None*
- ``client_key_path``: **Optional[Path(absolute=True, mode=os.R_OK)]** = *None*




TaskLabelRegexGenerator
=======================

Generate new label value based on other label value.
