    Build list of dicts, where each dict item has 3 key-value pairs,

    I suppose it does not really match what a jinja2 filter should
    consitute (general purpose, not matching just one use case).
    However, in that particular situation it is much simpler to write the custom filter
    than construct the result using build-in jinja2 filters.
