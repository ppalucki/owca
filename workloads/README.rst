.. contents:: Table of Contents


Description
===========

This folder contains:

- dockerfiles to build workloads images,
- aurora job definitions,
- ansible playbook `run_workloads.yaml`_ to schedule all workloads on Aurora cluster.

Building wrappers
=================

Wrapper module provides a framework for parsing application output and
sending metrics in prometheus format to a Kafka broker.

.. code-block:: sh

    make wrapper_package

Wrapper executables are as ``dist/wrapper_*.pex`` files.

Building docker images with wrappers
====================================

Note that:

- most workload images require wrapper pex files (`Building wrappers`_),
- workload images are build from **repository top-level** (to have access to wrapper pex files),
- the convention is to prefix images names with string ``owca/``, e.g. ``owca/cassadra_stress``,
- sub directorires here e.g. ``cassandra_stress`` match image names.

To build image:

.. code-block:: sh

    # in repository top-level directory
    docker build -f workloads/stress_ng/Dockerfile -t owca/stress_ng .


Running individual Aurora jobs
==============================

Aurora files (``*.aurora``) contains definition of Aurora jobs.
Each aurora file includes `<common.aurora>`_ that defines
common required parameters.

The list of common parameters is:

A workload specific variables are documented in the workload aurora files.


Scheduling workloads
===============================

Use `run_workloads.yaml`_ playbook to run workloads on Aurora cluster.

Playbook requires ``Aurora client`` being installed on ansible host machine (please follow `official instructions
<http://aurora.apache.org/documentation/latest/operations/installation/#installing-the-client>`_ to install and
configure the client properly).

`run_workloads.yaml`_ playbook requires an inventory based on `run_workloads_inventory.template.yaml`_.
The template constitute an example how to configure a composition of workloads.

To run a workload instance on a specific cluster node we use aurora constraints mechanism.
In our solution this requires to mark Mesos nodes with an attribute named ``own_ip``.
Then to assign a job to a specific node the value of the parameter ``own_ip`` needs to match
the value of a mesos attribute set on the node.
For more information about aurora constrainst and mesos attributes can be found in
`official aurora documentation <http://aurora.apache.org/documentation/latest/features/constraints/>`_.

.. _`run_workloads.yaml`: run_workloads.yaml
.. _`run_workloads_inventory.template.yaml`: run_workloads_inventory.template.yaml

Inventory structure
------------------------------------------
As it was noted, the reference for creating an inventory is a file `run_workloads_inventory.template.yaml`_.
The template file contains comments aimed at helping to understand the structure.

.. _`run_workloads_inventory.template.yaml`: run_workloads_inventory.template.yaml

Below resource allocation definition for a workload. It will be applied to all hosts.

.. code-block:: yaml

    application_hosts:
        hosts:
            # ....
        vars:
            # ....
            workloads:
                cassandra_ycsb:                # workload_name
                    default:                   # workload_version_name
                        cassandra:             # job_id
                            resources:
                                cpu: 8
                                disk: 4
                        ycsb:                  # job_id
                            resources:
                                cpu: 1.5

We can overwrite set values for a choosen host (we also need to set hash_behaviour to merge, please refer to
`doc <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/intro_configuration.html#hash-behaviour>`_).
To achieve this we create dictionary ``workloads`` under the choosen host:

.. code-block:: yaml

    application_hosts:
        hosts:
            10.10.10.9.4:
                env_uniq_id: 4
                workloads:                      # overwriting for a choosen host
                    default:
                        cassandra_ycsb:         #
                            resources:          #
                                cpu: 4          #

        vars:
            # ....
            workloads:
                cassandra_ycsb:                 # workload_name
                    default:
                        cassandra:              # job_id
                            resources:
                                cpu: 8
                                disk: 4
                        ycsb:
                            resources:
                                cpu: 1.5


Below we include an example configuration of a workload with comments marking values which translates
into common.aurora parameteres:

The rule of building aurora ``job_key`` (string identifying an aurora job, required argument in command ``aurora job create``) is:
``{{cluster}}/{{role}}/staging{{env_uniq_id}}/{{workload_name}}.{{workload_version_name}}--{{job_id}}--{{job_uniq_id}}.{{job_replica_index}}``.
The shell commands which will be executed by ansible as a result are as follow:

.. code-block:: sh

    # first instance of the workload
    # two replicas of load generators
    aurora job create example/root/staging127/cassandra_ycsb.default--ycsb--3333.0
    aurora job create example/root/staging127/cassandra_ycsb.default--ycsb--3333.1
    aurora job create example/root/staging127/cassandra_ycsb.default--cassandra--3333.0

    # second instance of the workload
    # two replicas of load generators
    aurora job create example/root/staging127/cassandra_ycsb.default--ycsb--3334.0
    aurora job create example/root/staging127/cassandra_ycsb.default--ycsb--3334.1
    aurora job create example/root/staging127/cassandra_ycsb.default--cassandra--3334.0


    # Here will goes commands for 'big' workload version
    aurora job create example/root/staging127/cassandra_ycsb.big--ycsb--3333.0
    # ...
